Description: Generate ground truth cases for object localization algorithms. 
    Cycle through a list of images, select points around which to generate bounding 
    boxes and assign classifiers. Output the coordinates, and images annotated with 
    boxes and labels. For an example study that uses bounding boxes for image 
    localization and classification see Ibrahim, Badr, Abdallah, and Eissa (2012)
