Description: Use boundingbox functions to generate ground truth cases for object 
    localization algorithms. Cycle through a list of images. Select between 2 and 26 
    points on an image. The boxer() function will output the image with a bounding 
    box based on the max/min coordinates and a dataframe of the coordinates. Also 
    allows  to resize the image, change the box color, add a common classifier to the 
    dataframe and to the image. boxer2() also allows for multiple bounding boxes 
    per image, and selection of a classifier per bounding box.  For an example study
    that uses bounding boxes for image localization and classification see
