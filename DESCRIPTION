Version: 1.0.0

Description: Cycle through a list of images. Select between 2 and 26 points on 
    an image. The boxer() function will output the image with a bounding box based 
    on the max/min coordinates and a dataframe of the coordinates. Also allows
    to resize the image, change the box color, add a common classifier to the 
    dataframe and to the image. boxer2() also allows for multiple bounding boxes 
    per image, and selection of a classifier per bounding box.
