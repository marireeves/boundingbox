Description: Cycle through a list of images. Select between 2 and 26 points on 
    an image. The boxer() function will output the image with a bounding box based 
    on the max/min coordinates and a dataframe of the coordinates. Also allows
    to resize the image, change the box color, add a classifier to the dataframe
    and to the image.
